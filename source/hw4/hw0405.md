# HW0405 Bonus: Wildcard

41047029S 林振可

There are two assumptions:

- `rm` implements a wildcard pattern matching algorithm in its source code.
- The shell do the expansion of wildcard pattern matching before passing the arguments to `rm`.

The first assumption looks good, but after digging into the source code of `rm` in a linux distribution, I found that the wildcard pattern matching algorithm is not implemented in the source code. 😢

So, I decided to check if the second assumption is correct.

If the matching algorithm is implemented by the shell, then any program should be able to use the wildcard pattern matching.

Then, I just send the following command to my shell (`bash`) within a directory having 3 `.txt` files.

```bash
echo *.txt > out
```

And I got the following output:

```bash
root@e479a80e3462:/usr/x# ls
a.txt  b.txt  c.txt
root@e479a80e3462:/usr/x# echo *.txt > out
root@e479a80e3462:/usr/x# ls
a.txt  b.txt  c.txt  out
root@e479a80e3462:/usr/x# cat out
a.txt b.txt c.txt
```

Great! Then I believe that my program can get the same things too.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int c, char* v[]) {
    for (int i = 1; i < c; i++) {
        printf("%d: %s\n", i, v[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

I think I didn't implement the wildcard pattern matching algorithm in the above program.

Take out a free wildcard pattern matching algorithm!

```bash
root@e479a80e3462:/usr/x# gcc test.c
root@e479a80e3462:/usr/x# ./a.out
root@e479a80e3462:/usr/x# ./a.out *.txt
1: a.txt
2: b.txt
3: c.txt
```

Excellent!
