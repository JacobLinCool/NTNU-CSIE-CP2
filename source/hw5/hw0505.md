# Bonus: Whatâ€™s Wrong

There are 3 situations:

- Alice's case
- Bob's case
- Catherine's case

In the first situation, Alice declares `str` as an **automatic local variable**.

So the variable is stored in **Stack**.

In the second situation, Bob declares `str` as a **static local variable** without initializing it.

So the variable is stored in **BSS**.

In the third situation, Catherine declares `str` as a **global variable** without initializing it.

So the variable is stored in **BSS**.

We know that the size limit of each frame on **Stack** is fixed size and smaller than the size limit of **BSS**. So if we store a variable of 10,000,000 bytes in **Stack**, it will be **overflowed**. But if we store a variable of 10,000,000 bytes in **BSS**, everything will be fine.

But we can use `ulimit -s 12000` to change the size limit of each **Stack** frame to 12,000 (kb) and avoid the **overflow**. The trade-off is that we will have fewer **Stack** frames to do recursion.
