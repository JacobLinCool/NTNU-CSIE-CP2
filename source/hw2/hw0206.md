```c=
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main()
{
    int32_t number = 0;

    scanf( "%d", & number );

    int32_t bit = 1;
    bit = bit << 31;

    for( int i = 0 ; i < 32 ; i++ )
    {
        if( bit & number )
            printf( "1" );
        else
            printf( "0" );
        bit = bit >> 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In line 11, the program uses the bitwise operator `<<` to shift the bit to the left by 31 bits:

```c
0b10000000000000000000000000000000
```

Then, the program uses the bitwise operator `&` to check if the bit is 1 or 0 in each bit position.

It uses `>>` to shift the bit to the right.

But it caused a problem, the `>>` operator on signed integer padding `1` to the left, not `0`.

That is, the program will fail when dealing with negative number because the sign bit of negative number is 1 and will be always resolved to 1 with `& bit`.

To resolve this problem, we can simply change `int32_t` to `int64_t`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <inttypes.h>

int main() {
    int64_t number = 0;

    scanf("%" PRId64, &number);

    int64_t bit = 1;
    bit = bit << 31;

    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        if (bit & number)
            printf("1");
        else
            printf("0");
        bit = bit >> 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Then, the program works. 🎉🎉🎉
